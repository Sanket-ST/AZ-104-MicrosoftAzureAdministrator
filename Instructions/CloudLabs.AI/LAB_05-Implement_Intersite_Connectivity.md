### Instructions

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy three virtual machines, each into a separate virtual network, with two of them in the same Azure region and the third one in another Azure region. 

1. Sign in to the https://portal.azure.com.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, select **Show advanced settings** and then select **Use existing** and choose existing resource group. Then select **Create new** against Storage account as well as File Share and provide a unique value in both of the fields and then click on **Create storage**.  

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **C:\\AllFiles\\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\\Allfiles\\Labs\\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json** and **C:\\AllFiles\\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\\Allfiles\\Labs\\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to use existing first resource group that will be hosting the lab environment. The first two virtual networks and a pair of virtual machines will be deployed in `[Azure_region_1]`. The third virtual network and the third virtual machine will be deployed in the same resource group but another `[Azure_region_2]`. (replace the `[Azure_region_1]` and `[Azure_region_2]` placeholder with the names of two different Azure regions where you intend to deploy these Azure virtual machines):

   >**Note**: deploymentId is the deployment-id of your lab and if need to know it, please find it in environment details tab. Please replace [deploymentId] with deployment-id

   ```pwsh
   $location1 = '[Azure_region_1]'

   $location2 = '[Azure_region_2]'

   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-[deploymentId]'

   ```

   >**Note**: In order to identify Azure regions, from a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell, run **(Get-AzLocation).Location**   
   
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the three virtual networks and deploy virtual machines into them by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json `
      -location1 $location1 `
      -location2 $location2 `
      -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next task. This should take about 2 minutes.

    >**Note**: To verify the status of the deployments, you can examine the properties of the resource group you are using in this task.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure local and global virtual network peering

In this task, you will configure local and global peering between the virtual networks you deployed in the previous tasks.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual networks**.

1. Review the virtual networks you created in the previous task and verify that the first two are located in the same Azure region and the third one in a different Azure region. 

    >**Note**: The template you used for deployment of the three virtual networks ensures that the IP address ranges of the three virtual networks do not overlap.

1. In the list of virtual networks, click **az104-05-vnet0**.

1. On the **az104-05-vnet0** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value|
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet1** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet0** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |	
    | I know my resource ID | unselected |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-05-vnet1** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |	

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-05-vnet0 to az104-05-vnet1 and the other from az104-05-vnet1 to az104-05-vnet0.

    >**Note**: In case you run into an issue with the Azure portal interface not displaying the virtual networks created in the previous task, you can configure peering by running the following PowerShell commands from Cloud Shell:
    
   ```powershell
   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-[deploymentId]'

   $vnet0 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet0' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   $vnet1 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet1' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet1' -VirtualNetwork $vnet0 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet1.Id

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet0' -VirtualNetwork $vnet1 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet0.Id
   ``` 

1. On the **az104-05-vnet0** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value|
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet2** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet0** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | unselected |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-05-vnet2** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |	

    >**Note**: This step establishes two global peerings - one from az104-05-vnet0 to az104-05-vnet2 and the other from az104-05-vnet2 to az104-05-vnet0.

    >**Note**: In case you run into an issue with the Azure portal interface not displaying the virtual networks created in the previous task, you can configure peering by running the following PowerShell commands from Cloud Shell:
    
   ```powershell
   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-[deploymentId]'

   $vnet0 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet0' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   $vnet2 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet2' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet2' -VirtualNetwork $vnet0 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet2.Id

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet0' -VirtualNetwork $vnet2 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet0.Id

1. Navigate back to the **Virtual networks** blade and, in the list of virtual networks, click **az104-05-vnet1**.

1. On the **az104-05-vnet1** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value|
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet2** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | This virtual network: Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet1** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | unselected |

    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None** |	

    >**Note**: This step establishes two global peerings - one from az104-05-vnet1 to az104-05-vnet2 and the other from az104-05-vnet2 to az104-05-vnet1.
    >**Note**: In case you run into an issue with the Azure portal interface not displaying the virtual networks created in the previous task, you can configure peering by running the following PowerShell commands from Cloud Shell:
    
   ```powershell
   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg1'

   $vnet1 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet1' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   $vnet2 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet2' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet2' -VirtualNetwork $vnet1 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet2.Id

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet1' -VirtualNetwork $vnet2 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet1.Id
   ``` 

#### Task 3: Test intersite connectivity
